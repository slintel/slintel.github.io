  Slintel uses API keys to authenticate and allow access to its users. 
  An API key is a token that a client provides when making API calls. 

  The API key is expected to be included as a request header.
  {: .info}
  
  If the API tokenâ€™s value is incorrect or unrecognized, you will receive a _**403 Forbidden**_ error message.
  {: .error}
